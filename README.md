# Concurrent Linked List

A concurrent linked list problem solution using explicit locks.

### The Problem

A linked list it is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. In this context, this data structure can perform the operations of insertion, remove and search of elements in the list. Thus, to perform concurrently it is necessary that these operations do not interfere in the behavior of the others, so that one can maintain correctness in the functions.

### Running

There are two ways to run this software:

* Compile the IDE (Eclipse - Java IDE):
1. Just open the IDE.
2. Import the project folder as a Java Project.
3. After, click in the "Run" button.
6. From this it only interacts with the system.

* Compile by terminal:
1. Enter the src folder and compile all the .java files with the following command:
```
$ java * .java -d <target_address_name>
```
2. Enter the chosen destination directory and run the following command:
```
$ java gui.Main
```
3. From this it only interacts with the system.

## Built With

* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) - A IDE used
